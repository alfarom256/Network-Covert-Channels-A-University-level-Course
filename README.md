## Introduction
This is a open online course for network covert channels. The course contains video material and slides that I use in my undergraduate and graduate courses at Worms University of Applied Sciences, Germany. I also used it at other universities, summer schools etc. over the years.

*Note:* More material will be added. You can always find the latest version of my slides here, as I updated these slides over the years and will continue to do so. Feel free to use my slides in your own class.

I made sure that references are using links so that you and your students can get easier access to the publications.
